"""
MessageHandler class that takes two arguments: OTP and phone_number. 
Phone_number is the phone number to which we want to send an OTP.
We have two functions in this class: one that is responsible for sending SMS and the other for sending WhatsApp messages.
We initialize the Client in both functions first, and then we send messages using Twilio functions.
Note that in the WhatsApp function, we will use a sandbox phone number instead of the number given to us by Twilio.
